# CrochetCraft

A multi-page static website for a handmade crochet business.

## What It Is

CrochetCraft is a three-page site — homepage, about, and contact — designed to showcase a crocheting business. The design uses purple and pink gradients to keep things warm and on-brand, and it's fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## How It's Structured

```
crochet-website/
│
├── index.html          # Homepage — hero section, features, gallery, testimonials
├── about.html          # About page — story, mission, values
├── contact.html        # Contact page — form, FAQ, business hours
├── styles.css          # All the styling
└── README.md           # This file
```

Pure HTML and CSS, no build step needed. Just open `index.html` in a browser and you're good.

## What's On Each Page

**Homepage** has a hero section with a call-to-action, a features breakdown, a gallery (using gradient placeholders for now), and a testimonials section.

**About** covers the company story, mission statement, the process behind each piece, and core values.

**Contact** has a form with validation-ready fields, business hours, social media links, and a small FAQ at the bottom.

## Design Details

The color scheme runs on two main gradients — a purple (`#667eea` → `#764ba2`) and a pink (`#f093fb` → `#f5576c`). Typography is Segoe UI with responsive sizing, and the layout uses Flexbox and Grid with media queries at 768px and 480px for tablet and mobile.

## What I'd Add Next

If I were to keep going with this one, I'd probably add JavaScript form validation, a smooth scroll navigation, and swap the gradient placeholders out for actual product images. A dark mode toggle would be a nice touch too.
